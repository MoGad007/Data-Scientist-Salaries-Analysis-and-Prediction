# Data Scientist Salaries Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project analyzes and predicts data scientist salaries using a combination of data processing and machine learning techniques. It aims to clean and process the dataset to train a predictive model effectively.

## Features

- Loads and cleans the dataset to remove duplicates and outliers.
- Encodes categorical features for model compatibility.
- Applies feature scaling and dimensionality reduction.
- Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict salaries.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy scores.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, PCA, SVM)
